<div class='poem'>
Sparkling as the dew-drops gleaming<br />
On her path, or sunlight streaming<br />
Through her tresses&mdash;graceful, fair,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>As naught on earth save Daisy Dare!<br />
<br />
Wondrous tresses! sunshine fades<br />
Mid floating curls and sumptuous braids,&mdash;<br />
A crown of light that glorifies<br />
White brow and deep impassioned eyes.<br />
<br />
Full, perfect, tempting were her lips&mdash;<br />
The bee or humming-bird that sips<br />
From scarlet blossoms in the South<br />
Beguiled might be by such a mouth.<br />
<br />
Her path ran by a rushing stream<br />
Which, like a crooked silver seam,<br />
Bound that green meadow to a wood,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Where soon with Graham Lee she stood.<br />
<br />
Softly through arching forest-trees<br />
Came stealing up a fresh salt breeze;<br />
One fair cheek kissing, till it burned<br />
Like to the other Lee-ward turned.<br />
<br />
"Daisy," he said, "I sail to-day<br />
For India, with Captain Gray;<br />
Will you not be upon the strand<br />
To say 'farewell'&mdash;to wave your hand?"<br />
<br />
"Yes; I will go to see you sail:"<br />
The tone was proud&mdash;her cheek turned pale;<br />
"I've promised to be there and say<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>A parting word to Allen Gray."<br />
<br />
The strong man's cheek grew white as death<br />
As thus, with short, unsteady breath,<br />
He said: "When last I went to sea,<br />
You waved, nay, kissed your hand to me."<br />
<br />
Her eyes flashed, smiling on him then&mdash;<br />
Such eyes hold fiery, earnest men<br />
In bondage, and to love beguile,<br />
Whether they mock, or weep, or smile.<br />
<br />
"Yes; I remember then to you<br />
I kissed my hand; but here are two:<br />
Can I not still kiss this one, pray,<br />
To you, and this to Allen Gray?"<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill-012.jpg" width="400" height="479" alt="&quot;Oh, do not mock me, Daisy Dare, With your small hands so soft and fair.&quot;" title="" />

<div class='poem'>
<br />
Her voice was deep, the words were light,<br />
The hands upheld were small and white,&mdash;<br />
Such hands as strong men love to grasp<br />
And crush in an impassioned clasp.<br />
<br />
"Oh, do not mock me, Daisy Dare,<br />
With your small hands so soft and fair;<br />
They may beguile both lovers&mdash;true;<br />
You cannot give your heart to two.<br />
<br />
"One or the other let it be;<br />
If Allen Gray, you're lost to me:<br />
If me, all hearts you must resign,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>All homage and all love save mine.<br />
<br />
"My guiding star across the brine,<br />
Has been the hope that called you mine;<br />
I'd rather see that load-star set,<br />
Than wed a fair, false, vain coquette.<br />
<br />
"I'd rather trust, though seas divide,<br />
Than linger doubting by your side:<br />
Now speak, what turns your heart away;<br />
The love of gold or Allen Gray?"<br />
<br />
Up rose her spirit, quick and proud;<br />
And, as through a translucent cloud<br />
Pour crimson streams of torrid light,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>The red blood dyed her forehead white.<br />
<br />
"I have not broken faith or vow,"<br />
She said; "but do release you now.<br />
My heart cannot be bought or sold<br />
By Allen Gray with love or gold.<br />
<br />
"I trifled with him but to try<br />
Your faith in me: I'd rather die<br />
Than wed a man of jealous heart:<br />
You cannot trust me, let us part.<br />
<br />
"The jealous love you bring to me,<br />
(As yonder green, impulsive sea<br />
Unto the shore doth come and go,)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>In passion tides would ebb and flow.<br />
<br />
"And as that surf, in fitful swells,<br />
Doth bring or bear away the shells<br />
From yonder strand,&mdash;such passion, strife<br />
Would fill, or desolate my life.<br />
<br />
"Such earthly crown of love to wear,<br />
The cross it brings I would not bear;<br />
Here! see me cast the burden down:<br />
Go!&mdash;for I yield you up the crown."<br />
<br />
The angry flush had faded now,<br />
Leaving her bosom, cheek, and brow<br />
Whiter than sea-foam 'neath the moon;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Her low voice as sad wind-harp's tune.<br />
<br />
She waved her hand and turned away:<br />
He caught it, crying, "Daisy, stay!<br />
Let not a flash of passion-pride<br />
Two clinging hearts like ours divide."<br />
<br />
She stood before him haughty, cold:<br />
"You taunted me with love of gold&mdash;<br />
Who wealth and titles scorned&mdash;to be<br />
The chosen bride of Graham Lee."<br />
<br />
"This choice, perhaps, you now regret,<br />
And crave a titled suitor yet;<br />
Hearts that are anchored side by side,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>No surface-ripple can divide."<br />
<br />
His words were bitter in their turn,<br />
And, like sharp acid on a burn,<br />
They scorched her heart, and seared the spot<br />
Where blossomed love's "forget-me-not."<br />
<br />
Oh, why are darts of anger hurled<br />
From heart to heart throughout the world;<br />
Fierce as the lightning&mdash;flashing far,<br />
From cloud to cloud, its red-hot bar?<br />
<br />
So quick, so sharp, too oft it cleaves<br />
The sandal-chain of love, and leaves<br />
But fragrant, broken, links at last<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>To bind us to a ruined past.<br />
<br />
Too often fixing deeps of woe<br />
Between us and the long ago;<br />
Bridging a gulf toward mem'ries green,<br />
With one regret&mdash;"it might have been."<br />
<br />
Oh, why, when life is in its June<br />
Of fruity fragrance, perfect tune,<br />
Does passion's stormy pride destroy<br />
Youths' heritage of love and joy?<br />
<br />
One jealous breath will oft disclose<br />
A canker in hope's perfect rose,<br />
For the false fever heat of strife<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>To nurse, and nourish into life.<br />
<br />
Oh, Daisy Dare! the sea is wide:<br />
Dear is the lover by thy side:<br />
The sea is treacherous, hungry, deep,<br />
And millions o'er its treasures weep.<br />
<br />
His heart relented&mdash;strong hearts do;<br />
Yet more relenting, oft less true<br />
Than those, unyielding, that defy<br />
The deathless love of which they die.<br />
<br />
"As forest saplings, by the sun<br />
Together knit till two are one&mdash;<br />
One trunk, one bark, one sap, one tree&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Our hearts have been, should ever be.<br />
<br />
"Let sharp steel cleave that circling rind,<br />
No art its severed strength could bind;<br />
Should anger part thy love from mine,<br />
Holds earth another heart for thine?"<br />
<br />
Oh, stubborn pride! unyielding still;<br />
Her heart is conquered; but her will<br />
Defies its tender, pleading tone:<br />
She left him&mdash;they were both alone.<br />

When eve her golden goblet fills<br />
Among the sunset's purple hills,<br />
And overflows that sunset wine<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>In streams of glory on the brine,<br />
<br />
Unto the shore a maiden came,<br />
Who gazed where, down that track of flame<br />
A steamer to the west did dip:<br />
Her heart went outward with the ship.<br />
<br />
She had not kept her tryst that day,<br />
Nor waved her hand to Allen Gray:<br />
Both little hands were still&mdash;'twas true<br />
She could not "give her heart to two."<br />
<br />
She heard the parting signals sound,<br />
And then the haughty pride that bound<br />
Her woman's heart, which had defied<br />
Her woman's love, grew faint and died.<br />

<div class='poem'>
She heard the steamship's iron bell;<br />
Turned to the shore, but faltered, fell&mdash;<br />
For ocean steamers do not wait<br />
On love&mdash;her pride gave way too late.<br />
<br />
"Too late!" she heard it rise and swell,<br />
Tolled by the iron steamer's bell;<br />
Told by the mocking voice of Fate,<br />
Rung through her heart, "too late!" "too late!"<br />
<br />
And now, when from that outward bound,<br />
Defiant distance brought no sound,<br />
She wandered hopeless to the strand,<br />
And, hopeless, westward waved her hand.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<br />
The steamer's black smoke drifting far<br />
Rose up and hid the evening star:<br />
A bitter symbol of that strife<br />
Between love's day-star and her life.<br />
<br />
In the late gloaming's purple gloom<br />
She wandered home; but half the bloom<br />
Had faded from her cheek and lips:<br />
Love's orient was in eclipse.<br />

"The ship went down!" such message crossed<br />
The lightning wire, and all were lost<br />
Save Captain Gray, and two or three;<br />
Among them was not Graham Lee.<br />
<br />
From Daisy's hand the paper fell;<br />
No cry she uttered, but a swell<br />
Of anguish through her heart did sweep,<br />
Bearing it downward to the deep.<br />
<br />
As the green pallor of a storm<br />
A summer landscape doth deform,<br />
Making a livid shadow grow<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Athwart the noon-day's ruddy glow,<br />
<br />
Across the future once so fair,<br />
So ripe with joy for Daisy Dare,<br />
Fate's cruel sickle swept, and left<br />
Life of its golden harvest reft.<br />

<div class='poem'>
Some months had passed&mdash;it was not long&mdash;<br />
When Daisy stood amid a throng,<br />
Turning her white cheek from the light,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Clasping her small hands fiercely tight!<br />
<br />
For she had heard two brave men say,&mdash;<br />
A stranger one&mdash;one Allen Gray,&mdash;<br />
No braver hero ever died<br />
Than he whose love she lost through pride.<br />
<br />
Unselfish, earnest, daring, brave,<br />
All but himself he tried to save;<br />
Heedless of death and danger&mdash;why?<br />
One heart alone could make reply.<br />
<br />
One spirit that had vainly sought<br />
Rest from a hungry surge of thought;<br />
Fierce retribution!&mdash;thus to be<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Tortured by praise of Graham Lee!<br />
<br />
Hero! but not for her to claim&mdash;<br />
There was the anguish, there the shame:<br />
How little yielding 'twould have cost<br />
To call him still her own, though lost.<br />
<br />
But she had cast away the right,<br />
And, mutely wretched, heard that night,<br />
With stormy heart and tearless cheek,<br />
His praise whose name she dared not speak.<br />
<br />
Few knew that they were lovers&mdash;none<br />
That their two hearts had pulsed as one;<br />
So the world called her cold and changed;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Friends thought her haughty and estranged.<br />
<br />
The current of her life's May-time<br />
Ran chill beneath a crust of rime;<br />
And lovers wore, for Daisy's sake,<br />
The icy chains they could not break.<br />
<br />
A yearning sadness in her face<br />
But added to that nameless grace,<br />
That spell by which some women reign<br />
In hearts they never strove to gain.<br />
<br />
Love fell on her superb repose<br />
Like warm light on a sculptured rose,<br />
As if&mdash;beguiled&mdash;to flush apart<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>The chiselled whiteness of its heart.<br />
<br />
The voice of passion to her soul<br />
Swept, as the storm-voiced surges roll<br />
Up toward a star-like beacon steep,<br />
Dashed backward rayless to the deep.<br />
<br />
As fire-fly lighting up a maze<br />
Of cobwebs with its dying blaze;<br />
Held by a grim black spider fast&mdash;<br />
Flashing with glory to the last.<br />
<br />
Thus tangled in a cruel fate,<br />
Dared through her folly, feared too late,<br />
The light of Daisy's lost love made<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>The past fall back in deepest shade.<br />
<br />
Strong natures suffer more than those<br />
Who, bowing down, parade their woes<br />
For a brief season, and then rise:<br />
The brave heart uncomplaining dies.<br />
<br />
So after years that inner gloom<br />
Had only softened Daisy's bloom,<br />
Giving such meaning to her eyes<br />
As worldlings cannot analyze.<br />
<br />
And when her pink cheek turned too soon<br />
Pale as magnolia buds in June,<br />
No one could call its fairness blight,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Or wish a flush upon the white.<br />
<br />
When just one shade of roundness passed<br />
From her proud form, they said at last<br />
That she must travel. Well she knew<br />
Love and regret would travel too!<br />
<br />
'Twas not one shore alone, whose surge<br />
Came wailing to her like a dirge;<br />
The surf, the waves of every sea,<br />
Everywhere, moaned of Graham Lee.<br />
<br />
And when in a far distant land,<br />
Upon a sunny southern strand,<br />
Where warm waves, green as malachite,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Come leaping, as from vats of light,<br />
<br />
Where summer's sumptuous golden blaze<br />
Wraps earth in a voluptuous haze<br />
Of lambent splendor; where the skies<br />
Drop balm as erst in Paradise,<br />
<br />
Where clusters of imperial trees<br />
Nod their green plumes o'er slumberous seas;<br />
Warm, amorous deeps! whose crystal calms<br />
Dream of the emerald-crested palms.<br />
<br />
A shore of bloom! a sea so bright!<br />
Entranced they mingle in the light;<br />
Apart&mdash;yet wedded by the sun,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>As severed hearts through love made one.<br />
<br />
Where air as an elixir fine<br />
Exhilarates like sparkling wine;<br />
Where mere existence brings a joy<br />
Life's trifling ills cannot destroy:<br />
<br />
There, where the aromatic breeze&mdash;<br />
Fledged in a nest of orange-trees,<br />
Kissing the slumb'rous waves&mdash;made sweet<br />
The sea-foam swept to Daisy's feet.<br />
<br />
The gloom, the shadow, passed not by;<br />
Still white her cheek, as shells that lie<br />
Like drifted snow on golden strand,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Where stood she writing in the sand.<br />
<br />
And still the envious surges came<br />
To wash away that precious name<br />
Writ on her heart's warm shore for years,<br />
Merged by its tidal flow of tears.<br />
<br />
She stood in a sequestered cove,<br />
While countless memories of love<br />
Heaped treasure, till her sea of grief<br />
Blushed&mdash;breaking on a coral-reef!<br />
<br />
For precious memories often grow<br />
From out the darkest voids of woe;<br />
As fissures by the sea-worm drilled<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>In Eastern shells, with pearls are filled.<br />
<br />
The creeping tide swells, shot with flame,<br />
Stole up and kissed away that name<br />
Which Fate indeed, with mocking hand,<br />
For her had written in the sand.<br />
<br />
Outward, upon her right did reach<br />
A long, white, narrow line of beach,<br />
Where careless groups now idly strayed,<br />
Watching the flush of sunset fade.<br />
<br />
And when across that crimson glow<br />
Her gaze went out as long ago,<br />
O'er colder seas, unto a ship<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Which toward the setting sun did dip,<br />
<br />
On the far point of that white sand<br />
Standing together, hand in hand,<br />
Like forms of sculptured bronze revealed<br />
Against the sunset's burnished shield,<br />
<br />
Two figures smote her 'wildered sight,<br />
And left two blots upon the light;<br />
Darker than iron ship afar<br />
Or smoke that hid the evening star.<br />
<br />
For there, between her and the sun,<br />
Stood Graham Lee, and with him one<br />
Whose beauty stirred to bitter strife<br />
The chilly current of her life.<br />

<br />
As summer sends a mighty thrill<br />
Through clust'ring icy floes, until<br />
Their shudd'ring breaks the ghastly sleep<br />
Of Nova Zembla's pallid deep.<br />
<br />
More dead he seemed to her that hour&mdash;<br />
There, in the strength of manly power,<br />
Bending to see those dark eyes shine&mdash;<br />
Than cold and still beneath the brine.<br />
<br />
Six years had marked their weary length<br />
On her young life&mdash;whose faith and strength<br />
A widowed heart left purified&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>To live, now wishing she had died.<br />
<br />
More lost she felt, and more alone,<br />
Leaning against that hard, cold stone,<br />
Than when his ship was outward bound,<br />
Or when she thought of him as drowned.<br />
<br />
They turned, and sauntered towards the cove;<br />
Oh, woman's strength! oh, woman's love!<br />
She stirred not till their eyes had met,<br />
And knew herself remembered yet.<br />
<br />
Down wastes of absence, grief, and gloom&mdash;<br />
Warmed by his gaze&mdash;uprose the bloom<br />
Of Hope's lost violets through the snow,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>A purple path to long ago!<br />
<br />
She saw the creole's large, dark eyes<br />
Glance up to his in mute surprise;<br />
She saw him leave the girl and stand<br />
Before her with an outstretched hand.<br />
<br />
Then turned and fled&mdash;no matter where,<br />
So those she fled from were not there&mdash;<br />
Seaward away, across the strand,<br />
Where hungry waves crept up the sand.<br />
<br />
On Memory's scroll there came a blot,<br />
A space of time remembered not;<br />
When sense awoke, clouds late aglow<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>With sunset fire, looked drifts of snow.<br />
<br />
For, like a disembodied soul<br />
By angels clad in silvery stole<br />
And shining sandals for its flight<br />
Along the upward paths of light,<br />
<br />
The moon had risen there, and turned<br />
Volcanic cloud-peaks while they burned,<br />
White as the frozen coronet<br />
On Jura's misty forehead set.<br />
<br />
And where, from out her casket fine,<br />
Eve had dropped rubies on the brine,<br />
In gleaming lengths of shimmering sheen<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Long lines of moonlight paved the green.<br />
<br />
Yet not to star, or sea, or skies<br />
She gazed, but into deep, dear eyes<br />
Bending upon her with the glow,<br />
The old, sweet love of long ago.<br />
<br />
Subtly it thrilled through every vein,<br />
Making her white cheek flush again;<br />
As pale hydrangeas blushing shine,<br />
Whose roots are steeped in purple wine.<br />
<br />
She felt love's subtle, potent charm<br />
Binding her on that strong right arm;<br />
'T was softer than the cold gray stone,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>'T was sweeter thus than all alone.<br />
<br />
One moment struggling to be free,<br />
She cried: "Release me, Graham Lee;<br />
For there is more to part us now<br />
Than distance, death, or broken vow."<br />
<br />
"Daisy"&mdash;his voice was deep and clear&mdash;<br />
"Stay; would I dare to hold you here<br />
So near my heart, if unto you<br />
That heart had ever been untrue?<br />
<br />
"Perchance, had I not found you soon,<br />
As yon gray cloud beside the moon<br />
Is silver-lined,&mdash;that wore a crown<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Of glory when the sun went down,<br />
"My future might have worn at last<br />
A light, which, likened to the past,<br />
Would be as yonder placid moon<br />
Unto the sumptuous suns of June.<br />
<br />
"You thought me dead&mdash;I thought you lost;<br />
Our hearts have both been tempest tossed,<br />
And never anchored since that hour<br />
When each defied the other's power.<br />
<br />
"The stately creole by my side<br />
Is my young sister&mdash;not my bride;<br />
Earth holds one mate alone for me,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>One bride&mdash;say, Daisy, shall it be?"<br />
<br />
No blot on the horizon's verge,<br />
No black smoke hid the star, no surge<br />
Came up to fret the silent sea,<br />
No answer came to Graham Lee.<br />
<br />
What need of words? From eye to eye<br />
How quick the magnet glances fly&mdash;<br />
Electric sparks from soul to soul&mdash;<br />
As magnets flash from pole to pole.<br />
<br />
From noiseless waters, stealing slow,<br />
The drooping white stalactites grow;<br />
From noiseless drops stalagmites rise,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Silent they meet, and crystallize.<br />
<br />
The overflowing loves that spring<br />
From two proud natures meeting, cling<br />
In strong, pure bliss from heart to home,<br />
As cavern spars from floor to dome.<br />

Spite of the promised whipping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Skirts, shirts, and aprons torn!</span><br />
Bugs and bumble-bees catching,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heedless of bites and stings,</span><br />
Walls and furniture scratching,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twisting off buttons and strings.</span><br />
Into the sugar and flour,<br />

Their royal, baby power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All through the house we feel!</span><br />
Behind the big stove creeping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To steal the kindling-wood;</span><br />
Into the cupboard peeping,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hunt for "somesin' dood."</span><br />
The dogs they tease to snarling,<br />

Yet the old cook calls them "darling,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And loves each one "the best."</span><br />
Smearing each other's faces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With smut or blacking-brush,</span><br />
To forbidden things and places<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Always making a rush.</span><br />
Over a chair, or table,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'll fight, and kiss again</span><br />
When told of slaughtered Abel,<br />

All sorts of mischief trying,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On sunny days&mdash;in doors</span><br />
And then perversely crying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To rush out when it pours.</span><br />
A raid on grandma making,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;In spite her nice new cap&mdash;</span><br />
Its strings for bridles taking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While riding on her lap.</span><br />
Three rose-bud mouths beguiling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Prattling the live-long day,</span><br />
Six sweet eyes on me smiling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hazel, and blue, and gray.&mdash;</span><br />
Hazel&mdash;with heart-light sparkling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too happy, we trust, to fade&mdash;</span><br />
Blue&mdash;'neath long lashes darkling,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like violets in the shade.</span><br />
Gray&mdash;full of earnest meaning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dawning light so fair,</span><br />
Of woman's life beginning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We dread the noon-tide glare</span><br />
Of earthly strife, and passion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May spoil its tender glow,</span><br />
Change its celestial fashion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As earth-stains change the snow!</span><br />
Six little clasped hands lifted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three white brows upward turned,</span><br />
One prayer&mdash;thrice heavenward drifted&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Him who never spurned</span><br />
The lisp of lips where laughter,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fading away in prayer,</span><br />
Leaves holy twilight after<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A noon of gladness there.</span><br />
Three little heads, all sunny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pillow and bless at night,&mdash;</span><br />
Riotous Alick and Dunnie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jinnie, so bonnie and bright!</span><br />
Three souls immortal slumber,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crowned by that golden hair;</span><br />
When Christ his flock shall number,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will all <i>my</i> lambs be there?</span><br />
Now, with the stillness round me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I bow my head and pray,</span><br />
"Since this faint heart has found thee,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Suffer them not to stray."</span><br />
Up to the shining portals,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over life's stormy tide,</span><br />
Treasures I bring&mdash;immortal;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saviour be thou my guide.</span><br />
